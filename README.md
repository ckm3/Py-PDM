# PDM-python-wrapper

This is a Python wrapper of the Phase Dispersion Minimization (PDM), which is a [C code written by Stellingwerf](https://www.stellingwerf.com/rfs-bin/index.cgi?action=PageView&id=34).

Compared with other Python implementations, with the help of Cython, we can obtain a much faster PDM tool.
